# CarpentryCon 2022
This repo will build the forthcoming website for CarpentryCon 2022.

Check out CarpentryCon 2020 at http://2020.carpentrycon.org/.

## Purpose and Scope

CarpentryCon is an annual conference that convenes the global Carpentries community. This conference zeroes in on:

- **Community Building:** bring together members of the Carpentry community, including instructors, partners, advocates, and staff, together with people sharing similar interests from around the globe. We will have a “come and learn” format that is different from most conferences.
- **Sharing Knowledge:** The event will include sessions on teaching methods, curriculum development, community organisation, and leadership skills. (As noted in the preamble, the final list of sessions will be determined by the program committee in consultation with the community, balancing “who wants to learn what?” with “who’s willing to teach what?”.)
- **Networking:** Opportunities will be provided for participants to come together informally to share stories about challenges and successes.
- **Contributed talks/posters:** There will be at least one session where attendees can share how they have incorporated Carpentry techniques into their own research and teaching, and/or how they have grown their local Carpentry community. This is crucial as presenting will be a requirement if attendees are seeking travel support from their home institution.

## The CarpentryCon Task Force (TF)

The CarpentryCon Task Force has been created within the carpentries to help organise and coordinate the CarpentryCon. All the roles and responsibilities of the TF member is described [here](https://github.com/carpentries/carpentrycon/blob/master/roles_and_responsibilities.md).

All the plans, progress and resources of TF are reported within this repository.
