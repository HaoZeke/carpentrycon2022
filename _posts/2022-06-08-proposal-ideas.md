## Hello Carpentries Community!

We're sending out a reminder that [we are currently accepting CarpentryCon
session proposals]({% post_url 2022-05-03-proposal-submission-open %}). The deadline is in less than a week, **12 June 2022**. 
We welcome sessions led in any language or time zone. 
There are a range of session types to choose from, and here are a few ideas
from Alycia Crall, The Carpentries Director of Community:

* Are you a yoga instructor? Propose a social event/informal meetup session to teach a class.
* Limited by time? Propose a 5-minute lightning talk that you can pre-record before the event.
* Pressing topic you would like to discuss with the community? Propose a breakout session.
* Have a new skill you want to share? Propose a skill-up workshop.
* Need support to develop a community resource? Propose a resource development sprint.
* Want to to hear from diverse perspectives on a topic? Propose a panel session.

Unsure or have questions? Email [carpentrycon@carpentries.org](mailto:carpentrycon@carpentries.org). We would love to hear from you!
