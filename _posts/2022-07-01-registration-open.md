## Volunteer

We invite volunteers to serve as [regional hosts](https://github.com/carpentrycon/carpentryconhome-proposals#volunteer-to-be-a-regional-host) who will act as the point of contact for session leads and be present at one or two sessions to support the presenter(s) by serving as Code of Conduct (CoC) facilitators, managing Zoom and other meeting logistics in each session.  Volunteers are also needed to communicate with the broader community via social media channels to share out upcoming sessions and highlights of the event.
