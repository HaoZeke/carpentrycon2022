This year’s theme for CarpentryCon is all-encompassing: we invite proposals for presentations that seek to **expand data frontiers.** Sub-themes will be compiled based on the submissions received, and [proposal submission is open until 12 June]({% post_url 2022-05-03-proposal-submission-open %}). You can propose various session types, including _breakout discussions_, _lesson and resource development sprints_, _lightning talks_, _panel sessions_, _skill-up workshops, _social events_, and _informal meetups_. 

Are you wondering if your research falls under the conference theme and if you should submit a proposal? The answer is probably a **YES**!

## Defining the Theme

We looked to Merriam-Webster for a starting point for the theme elements: 

**[Expanding](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/expanding)**

> To open up, to expand, to increase the extent, number, volume, scope.

**[Data](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/data)**

> Factual information used as a basis for reasoning, discussion, and calculation, digital information that can be transmitted or processed, information output.

**[Frontiers](https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/frontiers)**

> The farthermost limits of knowledge, new fields for activity.

## Thinking Creatively

We’d love it if you think creatively about expanding data frontiers. Here are some questions and ideas that we considered while elaborating the theme:

* Pushing past the limits to expand the frontiers of data:
    * What are those limitations? What might be a barrier, roadblock?
    * How are you dismantling and/or moving past them?
* Conversations and debates in the field: 
    * Tools, trends, and debates within computer science, data science, and other relevant fields.
    * Expanding the information, knowledge, and conversation within and beyond The Carpentries community. 
* Building collective knowledge through lessons learned teaching workshops, developing lessons, and receiving learner feedback:
    * Share a failure or success story: 
        * What did you learn? Key takeaways?
        * How do you move forward? Next steps?
* Current and Trending Topics: current and new research, ideas, methodologies, solutions, and next steps in areas including, but not limited to, the following:
    * _Community_ - expanding reach, communities of practice, networking, etc
    * _Computing_ - capacity and capability, tools, approaches, and resources, etc
    * _Data Democracy_ - confronting misinformation, open and transparent, approachable to general public, outcomes, etc
    * _Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion_ - data literacy curriculum, women in data, diverse perspectives, user accessibility, etc.
    * _Data security_ 
    * _Data ethics_
    * _Evaluation_ - data use policies, procedures, practices, etc.
    * _Literacy_ - pedagogy, curriculum, tools, tips and tricks, evaluation, adding new skills and languages, audience, etc.
