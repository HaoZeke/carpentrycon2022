## Announcing CarpentryCon 2022!

As [announced in October 2021](https://carpentries.org/blog/2021/10/carpentrycon-at-home-2022/), the bi-ennial CarpentryCon will be held again in 2022! The [2020 CarpentryCon](https://carpentries.org/blog/2020/04/changes-to-carpentrycon-2020/) was the first 100% virtual conference hosted by our organisation, and we made significant efforts to ensure the event was inclusive and accessible to any community member who wanted to participate.

**CarpentryCon @ Home 2022** will again be an online event, to be held from August 1 to 12. Although the 2020 decision was made quickly and due to the travel restrictions imposed by the pandemic, our experience helped to demonstrate some of the benefits of an online event. Given the continuing pandemic, we feel the online format remains the best way for us to ensure your safety in the ongoing pandemic, but it will also help to reduce our travel budgets, reduce our carbon footprint, and broaden the potential for participation beyond an in-person event.

## Task Force and Subcommittees

Planning has been underway since 2021, when we began seeking participants in the CarpentryCon planning [Task Force](/task-force/). Task force members work closely with The Carpentries Core Team members to ensure the event meets the needs of our broader community and is inclusive and accessible.

The Task Force has organized the following subcommittees for planning and hosting the online event:

- **Accessibility** -> develop an accessibility plan and support its implementation
- **Communications, Marketing and Outreach** -> develop a communications plan and support its implementation
- **Program and Schedule** -> develop a theme, list of conference tracks and relevant content (call for abstracts, etc.)
- **Website** -> develop and maintain the conference website

With your support, we are looking forward to another successful CarpentryCon @Home in 2022! Please come back to the website, where we will post updates and information as the plans come into focus. Additionally, and you can follow along on social or participate in the convsersation using the hashtag [#CarpentryConAtHome](https://twitter.com/hashtag/CarpentryConAtHome).
